# File Storage

You can connect files from [file storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage)
to your ents.

The basic way to do this is the same as in vanilla Convex, adding a storage ID
field:

```ts
defineEntSchema({
  users: defineEnt({
    name: v.string(),
    photoId: v.id("_storage"),
  }),
});
```

You can then retrieve the file URL for serving, update the ID etc. For example,
to retrieve all users with URLs to their photos:

```ts
return ctx.table("users").map(async (user) => ({
  ...user,
  photoUrl: await ctx.storage.getUrl(user.photoId),
}));
```

## Using edges for cascading deletes

The one downside to this approach is that [cascading deletes](/schema/deletes)
do not propagate to referenced files, leaving orphaned files behind. To handle
this scenario Ents support specifying the connection to files as a 1:1 edge:

```ts
defineEntSchema({
  users: defineEnt({
    name: v.string(),
  }).edge("photo", { to: "_storage", deletion: "hard" }),
});
```

The field name is derived from the edge name (here `fieldId`), you can also
specify it with the `field` option.

You can automatically delete a connected file via the `deletion` option. Only
the `"hard"` value is valid, since there is no way to mark soft deletion on a
document in file storage.

Note that if you use `ctx.storage.delete` to delete a file that is referenced in
other ents, Ents will not cascade that deletion. Ideally do not use
`ctx.storage.delete`, or handle any other required deletions manually.

### Get file metadata via edge

If you traverse the edge you will receive the
[file metadata](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage/file-metadata):

```ts
const photoMetadata = await user.edge("photo");
```
