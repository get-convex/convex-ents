# Scheduled Functions

You can connect
[scheduled functions](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions) to
your ents.

The basic way to do this is the same as in vanilla Convex, adding a scheduled
function ID field:

```ts
defineEntSchema({
  answers: defineEnt({
    question: v.string(),
    actionId: v.id("_scheduled_functions"),
  }),
});
```

You can then retrieve the scheduled function status and cancel it. For example,
to retrieve all answers with the status of their action:

```ts
return ctx.table("answers").map(async ({ question, actionId }) => ({
  question,
  status:
    (await ctx.table("_scheduled_functions").get(actionId)?.state.kind) ??
    "stale",
}));
```

## Using edges for connecting scheduled functions

You can simplify the code above by declaring a 1:1 edge to scheduled functions:

```ts
defineEntSchema({
  answers: defineEnt({
    question: v.string(),
  }).edge("action", { to: "_scheduled_functions" }),
});
```

The field name is derived from the edge name (here `actionId`), you can also
specify it with the `field` option.

You can then retrieve scheduled function status via the edge:

```ts
return ctx.table("answers").map(async (answer) => ({
  question: answer.question,
  status: (await answer.edge("action")?.state.kind) ?? "stale",
}));
```

### Automatic cancelation during cascading deletion

You can automatically cancel a connected scheduled function via the `deletion`
option:

```ts
defineEntSchema({
  answers: defineEnt({
    question: v.string(),
  }).edge("action", { to: "_scheduled_functions", deletion: "hard" }),
});
```

Only the `"hard"` value is valid, since there is no way to mark soft deletion on
a scheduled function.

In this example when an answer is deleted, its action, if pending or
in-progress, is canceled.

Note that if you use `ctx.storage.delete` to delete a file that is referenced in
other ents, Ents will not cascade that deletion. Ideally do not use
`ctx.storage.delete`, or handle any other required deletions manually.

### Get file metadata via edge

If you traverse the edge you will receive the
[file metadata](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage/file-metadata):

```ts
const photoMetadata = await user.edge("photo");
```
