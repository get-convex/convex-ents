# Reading Ents from the Database

Convex Ents provide a `ctx.table` method which replaces the built-in `ctx.db`
object in Convex [queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions).
The result of calling the method is a custom object which acts as a lazy
`Promise`. If you `await` it, you will get a list of results. But you can
instead call another method on it which will return a different lazy `Promise`,
and so on. This enables a powerful and efficient fluent API.

## Security

The Convex Ents API was designed to add an additional level of security to your
backend code. The built-in `ctx.db` object allows reading data from and writing
data to any table. Therefore in vanilla Convex you must correctly use both
[argument validation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/args-validation) and
[strict schema validation](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) to avoid
exposing a function which could be misused by an attacker to act on a table it
was not designed to act on.

All Convex Ents APIs require specifying a table up-front. If you need to read
data from an arbitrary table, you must the
[use the built-in `ctx.db`](/setup/config) object.

## Reading a single ent by ID

```ts
const task = await ctx.table("tasks").get(taskId);
```

This is equivalent to the built-in:

```ts
const task = await ctx.db.get(taskId);
```

with the addition of checking that `taskId` belongs to `"tasks"`.

## Reading a single ent by indexed field

```ts
const task = await ctx.table("users").get("email", "steve@apple.com");
```

This is equivalent to the built-in:

```ts
const task = await ctx.db
  .query("users")
  .withIndex("email", (q) => q.eq("email", "steve@apple.com"))
  .unique();
```

## Reading a single ent or throwing

The `getX` method (pronounced "get or throw") throws an `Error` if the read
produced no ents:

```ts
const task = await ctx.table("tasks").getX(taskId);
```

```ts
const task = await ctx.table("users").getX("email", "steve@apple.com");
```

## Listing all ents

To list all ents backed by a single table, simply `await` the `ctx.table` call:

```ts
const tasks = await ctx.table("users");
```

This is equivalent to the built-in:

```ts
const tasks = await ctx.db.query("users").collect();
```

## Listing ents filtered by index

To list ents from a table and efficiently filter them by an index, pass the
index name and filter callback to `ctx.table`:

```ts
const posts = await ctx.table("posts", "numLikes", (q) =>
  q.gt("numLikes", 100)
);
```

This is equivalent to the built-in:

```ts
const posts = await ctx.db
  .query("posts")
  .withIndex("numLikes", (q) => q.gt("numLikes", 100))
  .collect();
```

## Filtering

Use the `filter` method, which works the same as the
[built-in `filter` method](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data#filtering):

```ts
const posts = await ctx
  .table("posts")
  .filter((q) => q.gt(q.field("numLikes"), 100));
```

This is equivalent to the built-in:

```ts
const posts = await ctx.db
  .query("posts")
  .filter((q) => q.gt(q.field("numLikes"), 100))
  .collect();
```

## Ordering

Use the `order` method. The default sort is by `_creationTime` in ascending
order (from oldest created to newest created):

```ts
const posts = await ctx.table("posts").order("desc");
```

This is equivalent to the built-in:

```ts
const posts = await ctx.db.query("posts").order("desc").collect();
```

## Ordering by index

The `order` method takes an index name as a shortcut to sorting by a given
index:

```ts
const posts = await ctx.table("posts").order("desc", "numLikes");
```

This is equivalent to the built-in:

```ts
const posts = await ctx
  .table("posts")
  .withIndex("numLikes")
  .order("desc")
  .collect();
```

## Limiting results

### Taking first `n` ents

```ts
const users = await ctx.table("users").take(5);
```

### Finding the first ent

Useful chained, either to a `ctx.table` call using an index, or after `filter`,
`order`, `edge`.

```ts
const latestUser = await ctx.table("users").order("desc").first();
```

### Finding the first ent or throwing

The `firstX` method (pronounced "first or throw") throws an `Error` if the read
produced no ents:

```ts
const latestUser = await ctx.table("users").order("desc").firstX();
```

### Finding a unique ent

Throws if the listing produced more than 1 result, returns `null` if there were
no results:

```ts
const counter = await ctx.table("counters").unique();
```

### Finding a unique ent or throwing

The `uniqueX` method (pronounced "unique or throw") throws if the listing
produced more or less than 1 result:

```ts
const counter = await ctx.table("counters").uniqueX();
```

### Loading a page of ents

A `paginate` functions works the same as
[the built-in pagination](https://docs.convex.dev/database/pagination).
Currently it cannot be chained.

## Traversing edges

Convex Ents allow easily traversing edges declared in the [schema](/schema).

### Traversing 1:1 edge

The `edge` method returns an ent for 1:1 edges, or `null` if starting from the
"optional" end of the edge:

```ts
const profile = await ctx.table("users").getX(userId).edge("profile");
```

The `edgeX` method (edge or throw) throws if the edge does not exist:

```ts
const profile = await ctx.table("users").getX(userId).edgeX("profile");
```

### Traversing 1:many edges

The `edge` method returns either a list of ents, or a single ent (or null) for
1:many edges, depending on which end of the edge is used:

```ts
const messages = await ctx.table("users").getX(userId).edge("messages");
```

```ts
const user = await ctx.table("message").getX(messageId).edge("user");
```

### Traversing many:many edges

The `edge` method returns either a list of ents for many:many edges:

```ts
const tags = await ctx.table("messages").getX(messageId).edge("tags");
const messages = await ctx.table("tags").getX(tagId).edge("messages");
```

### Traversing edges on retrieved ents

All the methods for reading ents return the underlying document(s), enriched
with the `edge` and `edgeX` methods. This allows traversing edges even after
loading the ent from the database:

```ts
const user = await ctx.table("users").firstX();
const profile = user.edgeX("profile");
```

## Mapping ents

To map, that is to produce a new Array by calling a function on each element of
the original Array, using `async` functions is quite unwieldy in JavaScript
without the use of libraries. For this reason all lazy promises of a list of
ents support the `map` method:

```ts
const usersWithMessagesAndProfile = await ctx
  .table("users")
  .map(async (user) => ({
    ...user,
    messages: await user.edge("messages"),
    profile: await user.edgeX("profile"),
  }));
```

This code is equivalent to this code using only built-in Convex and JavaScript
functionality:

```ts
const usersWithMessagesAndProfile = await Promise.all(
  (
    await ctx.db.query("users").collect()
  ).map(async (user) => ({
    ...user,
    posts: await ctx.db
      .query("messages")
      .withIndex("userId", (q) => q.eq("userId", user._id))
      .collect(),
    profile: (async () => {
      const profile = await ctx.db
        .query("profiles")
        .withIndex("userId", (q) => q.eq("userId", user._id))
        .unique();
      if (profile === null) {
        throw new Error(
          `Edge "profile" does not exist for document wit ID ${user._id}`
        );
      }
      return profile;
    })(),
  }))
);
```
