# Project Status

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Ents is in maintenance mode. We're open to taking PRs, and will make sure it
  doesn't break. There will not be active feature development from the Convex
  team.
</Callout>

Convex Ents are in early preview.

## I found a bug

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/xixixao/convex-ents/issues/new) or
open a PR [on GitHub](https://github.com/xixixao/convex-ents).

## Should I use Convex Ents instead of `ctx.db`?

The built-in `ctx.db` is maintained by Convex and is guaranteed stable (existing
code will continue to work) until the next major version of Convex.

Convex Ents are a bleeding-edge community project, which might evolve over time,
with no guarantee on backwards compatibility for now (similar to
`convex-helpers`).

If your project involves a lot of relationships between tables, give Convex Ents
a try and [let us know on Discord](https://www.convex.dev/community) how it
goes.

## Should I use rules?

[Rules](/schema/rules) for enforcing authorization rules are an advanced
feature, and come with a drawback: It is less clear from code what is happening
under the hood. Any retrieval from a table which has a read rule set up
essentially adds an in-JS `filter` and can also read more documents than
requested.

Try out rules if you have a need for them and are confident that you can reason
about the performance of your code with rules in-place.
