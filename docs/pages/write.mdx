# Writing Ents to the Database

Just like for [reading](/read) ents from the database, for writing Convex Ents
provide a `ctx.table` method which replaces the built-in `ctx.db` object in
[Convex mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions).

## Security

The same [added level of security](/read#security) applies to the writing ents
as it does to reading them.

## Inserting a new ent

You can insert new ents into the database with the `insert` method chained to
the result of calling `ctx.table`:

```ts
const taskId = await ctx.table("tasks").insert({ text: "Win at life" });
```

You can retrieve the just created ent with the `get` method:

```ts
const task = await ctx.table("tasks").insert({ text: "Win at life" }).get();
```

<Aside title="This is equivalent to the built-in:">

```ts
const taskId = await ctx.db.insert("tasks", { text: "Win at life" });
const task = (await ctx.db.get(taskId))!;
```

</Aside>

## Inserting many new ents

```ts
const taskIds = await ctx
  .table("tasks")
  .insertMany({ text: "Buy socks" }, { text: "Buy socks" });
```

## Updating existing ents

To update an existing ent, call the `patch` or `replace` method on a
[lazy `Promise`](/read) of an ent, or on an already retrieved ent:

```ts
await ctx.table("tasks").getX(taskId).patch({ text: "Changed text" });
await ctx.table("tasks").getX(taskId).replace({ text: "Changed text" });
```

```ts
const task = await ctx.table("tasks").getX(taskId);
await task.patch({ text: "Changed text" });
await task.replace({ text: "Changed text" });
```

See the
[docs for the built-in `patch` and `replace` methods](https://docs.convex.dev/database/writing-data#updating-existing-documents)
for the difference between them.

## Deleting ents

To delete an ent, call the `delete` method on a [lazy `Promise`](/read) of an
ent, or on an already retrieved ent:

```ts
await ctx.table("tasks").getX(taskId).delete();
```

```ts
const task = await ctx.table("tasks").getX(taskId);
await task.delete();
```

### Cascading deletes

See the [Cascading Deletes](/schema/deletes) page for how to configure how
deleting an ent affects its edges and other ents connected to it.

## Creating edges

Edges can be created together with ents using the `insert` and `insertMany`
methods, or they can be created for two existing ents using the `replace` and
`patch` methods.

### Creating 1:1 and 1:many edges

A 1:1 or 1:many edge can be created by specifying the ID of the other ent on
[the ent which stores the edge](/schema#understanding-how-edges-are-stored),
either when inserting:

```ts
// First we need a user, which can have an optional profile edge
const userId = await ctx.table("users").insert({ name: "Alice" });
// Now we can create a profile with the 1:1 edge to the user
const profileId = await ctx
  .table("profiles")
  .insert({ bio: "In Wonderland", userId });
```

or when updating:

```ts
const profileId = await ctx.table("profiles").getX(profileId).patch({ userId });
```

<Aside title="This is equivalent to the built-in:">

```ts
const posts = await ctx.db.patch(profileId, { userId });
```

with the addition of checking that `profileId` belongs to `"profiles"`.

</Aside>

### Creating many:many edges

Many:many edges can be created by listing the IDs of the other ents when
inserting ents on either side of the edge:

```ts
// First we need a tag, which can have many:many edge to messages
const tagId = await ctx.table("tags").insert({ name: "Blue" });
// Now we can create a message with a many:many edge to the tag
const messageId = await ctx
  .table("messages")
  .insert({ text: "Hello world", tags: [tagId] });
```

But we could have equally created a message first, and then created a tag with a
list of message IDs.

The `replace` method also expects a list of IDs:

```ts
await ctx
  .table("messages")
  .getX(messageId)
  .replace({ text: "Changed message", tags: [tagID, otherTagID] });
```

Because `replace` essentially behaves like a `delete` + `insert` but preserves
the `_id` and `_creationTime` fields of the replaced ent, any edges which are
not listed will be deleted.

The `patch` method on the other hand expects a description of the changes that
should be made, a list of IDs to `add` and `remove` edges for:

```ts
const message = await ctx.table("messages").getX(messageId);
await message.patch({ tags: { add: [tagID] } });
await message.patch({
  tags: { add: [tagID, otherTagID], remove: [tagToDeleteID] },
});
```

Any edges in the `add` list that didn't exist are created, and any edges in the
`remove` list that did exist are deleted. Edges to ents with ID not listed in
either list are not affected by `patch`.
